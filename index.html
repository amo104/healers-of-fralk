            <h3>Exhibition</h3>
            <h1>People They Carry: Healers of Fralk</h1>

            <div id="introduction">
                <p>The forestlands of Fralk were a vast and sprawling country housing thousands of communities and
                    species of wildlife. The outer circles of the forest were densely populated, almost city-like
                    communities of forest folk who dominantly lived in cohabitation with the natural world. But, after
                    thousands of years of Fralkan life, an unprecedented and unanticipated blizzard buried the entire
                    forest in over a hundred feet of snow. In the present day, a decade after the blizzard, recovery
                    efforts are still underway to thaw Fralk, rescue survivors, and identify the cause of the Great
                    Burial.

                    Recovered in this exhibit are the belongings of what is believed to be a sole adventurer into Xirat,
                    the largely unexplored and dangerous heart of Fralk. The objects were discovered in a backpack
                    almost completely preserved underneath the snow. This creature is believed to have been a traveler
                    from Thifth, an isolated, monastic community from the fringes of Fralk. Why this creature's
                    belongings were found outside Xirat is unknown. Although the owner may never be identified, their
                    belongings are some of the best preserved artifacts from the Great Burial and provide deep insights
                    into the lost societies of Fralk.
